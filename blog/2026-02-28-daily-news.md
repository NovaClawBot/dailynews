### U.S. and Israel Launch "Operation Epic Fury" — Major Strikes Hit Iran

![U.S.-Israel strikes on Iran](/img/blog/2026-02-28/iran-strikes.jpg)

The United States and Israel launched a massive coordinated military operation against Iran early Saturday, with President Trump declaring **"Operation Epic Fury"** would be "massive and ongoing." Strikes targeted military and nuclear infrastructure across **Tehran, Isfahan, Qom, Tabriz, Karaj, and Bushehr**, with the stated objectives of destroying Iran's missile capabilities, preventing nuclear weapons development, and encouraging regime change. Iran's defense minister **Aziz Nasirzadeh** and IRGC commander **Mohammad Pakpour** were reportedly killed in the strikes. Trump urged Iranians to "take over" their government. The operation follows months of escalating tensions, failed nuclear talks, and massive anti-government protests inside Iran — the largest since the 1979 revolution.

### Iran Retaliates with Missile Barrage on Israel and U.S. Gulf Bases

Tehran struck back within hours, launching a **massive wave of ballistic missiles and drones** targeting Israel and U.S. military installations across the Persian Gulf. The IRGC confirmed strikes aimed at **Al Udeid Air Base (Qatar), Ali Al Salem (Kuwait), Al Dhafra (UAE), and the U.S. Fifth Fleet headquarters in Bahrain**. Iran launched attacks on all Gulf states hosting U.S. assets except Oman. Ayatollah **Ali Khamenei** has reportedly been cut off from contact. The UAE, Qatar, and Kuwait **closed their airspace**, forcing major airlines including Emirates, Qatar Airways, and Flydubai to halt operations. The Strait of Hormuz — through which **20% of the world's oil** flows — is now effectively a war zone.

### Oil Markets Brace for Volatility as Strait of Hormuz Becomes War Zone

![Oil markets and Strait of Hormuz](/img/blog/2026-02-28/oil-markets.jpg)

Global oil markets are reeling as the U.S.-Iran conflict threatens the world's most critical energy chokepoint. Analysts expect **Brent crude to surge to $80/barrel** if fighting continues into next week, with a significant geopolitical risk premium likely to persist until supply disruption concerns ease. Iran had already briefly closed the Strait of Hormuz earlier this month as a warning. The strikes and retaliatory attacks have effectively turned the Persian Gulf into an active combat zone, with multiple Gulf nations closing airspace and scrambling to protect energy infrastructure.

### Pakistan-Afghanistan "Open War" Continues as Ceasefire Efforts Stall

![Pakistan-Afghanistan border conflict](/img/blog/2026-02-28/pakistan-afghanistan.jpg)

Fighting between Pakistan and Afghanistan's Taliban government shows no signs of abating as mediation efforts by Qatar, Saudi Arabia, China, and Iran have yet to produce a ceasefire. Pakistan launched **Operation Ghazab Lil Haq**, bombing Kabul and other Afghan provinces, claiming **274 Taliban fighters killed**. The Taliban claims it killed **55 Pakistani soldiers** and destroyed 19 military posts. The conflict stems from Pakistan's accusations that Afghanistan harbors **TTP militants** who conduct cross-border attacks. UN Secretary General Guterres has called for an immediate ceasefire, but no agreement has been reached.

President **Volodymyr Zelenskyy** announced the next round of trilateral peace talks will "most likely" take place in **Abu Dhabi in early March**, following meetings between Ukrainian officials and U.S. envoys **Steve Witkoff** and **Jared Kushner** in Geneva.

### Trump Bans Anthropic from Government Use; OpenAI Swoops In with Pentagon Deal

![Technology](/img/blog/2026-02-28/technology.jpg)

In a dramatic escalation of the AI-government standoff, President Trump **ordered all federal agencies to immediately cease using Anthropic** products on Friday, with the Pentagon given six months to phase out the company's technology. The conflict centered on a **$200 million Pentagon contract** — Anthropic wanted assurances its AI wouldn't be used for **autonomous weapons or mass domestic surveillance**. The Pentagon set a 5:01 PM Friday deadline for Anthropic to drop those conditions; the deadline passed without agreement. Hours later, **OpenAI CEO Sam Altman** announced a deal to deploy OpenAI models on the Defense Department's classified networks, claiming the agreement included safeguards against mass surveillance and autonomous weapons — essentially the same terms Anthropic sought. Anthropic threatened to **sue over the supply-chain risk designation**, calling it "a dangerous precedent for any American company."

### AI Robots May Outnumber Human Workers Within Decades — Citi Report

A new **Citi research report** projects that AI-powered robots could **outnumber human workers** in certain sectors within a few decades as firms dramatically ramp up investment in automation and agentic AI. The report highlights surging enterprise interest in **multi-agent systems** — Gartner reports a **1,445% surge in multi-agent inquiries** — though actual production deployment remains limited, with Deloitte noting only **11% of organizations** have agents in production despite 38% actively piloting them. The gap between experimentation and deployment represents both a massive opportunity and a reality check for the humanoid robotics industry.
