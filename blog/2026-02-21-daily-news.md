### Supreme Court Strikes Down Trump's Tariffs — Trump Imposes New Ones Hours Later

![U.S. Supreme Court](/img/blog/2026-02-21/supreme-court.jpg)

In a landmark **6-3 ruling**, the Supreme Court struck down President Trump's sweeping emergency tariffs, finding he exceeded his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). Justices Gorsuch and Barrett joined the three liberal justices and Chief Justice Roberts in the majority. Within hours, Trump denounced the ruling as "a disgrace" and signed a **new 10% global tariff** using a different legal authority, escalating the confrontation between the executive and judicial branches.

The Pentagon has positioned **two aircraft carriers, fighter jets, and refueling tankers** in the region, with full forces expected in place by mid-March. Iran responded with joint military drills with Russia, while its UN ambassador warned any aggression would be met "decisively and proportionately."

![Nuclear energy](/img/blog/2026-02-21/nuclear-energy.jpg)

The U.S. military airlifted a **5-megawatt microreactor** nearly 700 miles from March Air Reserve Base in California to Hill Air Force Base in Utah aboard a C-17 — the first time a nuclear reactor has been transported by military aircraft. The minivan-sized reactor, built by a private company, can power roughly 5,000 homes and is one of at least three expected to reach "criticality" by **July 4**. The demonstration is part of the Trump administration's push to rapidly deploy nuclear power for AI data centers and military bases.

### Navalny Poisoned with Dart Frog Toxin, Five European Nations Conclude

Five European nations — the UK, France, Germany, Sweden, and the Netherlands — announced that lab analysis of samples from Alexei Navalny's body **"conclusively confirmed the presence of epibatidine,"** a toxin found in Ecuadorian poison dart frogs. The governments reported Russia to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, stating Russia "had the means, motive, and opportunity." Russia rejected the findings as propaganda.

### Fifth Circuit Clears Ten Commandments in Louisiana Classrooms

The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals voted **12-6** to lift a block on Louisiana's law requiring displays of the Ten Commandments in public classrooms. The court reasoned it was too early to determine constitutionality since implementation details — such as display prominence and accompanying texts — remain unclear. Republican Gov. Jeff Landry celebrated the ruling, while the ACLU pledged to continue fighting the law.

### International AI Safety Report 2026 Warns of Widening Gap

![AI research](/img/blog/2026-02-21/ai-research.jpg)

The second International AI Safety Report, led by Turing Award winner **Yoshua Bengio** and authored by over 100 experts from 30+ countries, warns that the gap between AI capability advances and safety safeguards "remains a critical challenge." The report highlights that leading AI systems now achieve **gold-medal-level performance** on math and science olympiads and exceed PhD-level expert benchmarks — while deepfake incidents and autonomous agent risks are rising. AI agents are increasingly common in research, software engineering, and customer service.

### MIT's Neural Blueprint Gives Soft Robots Human-Like Adaptability

![Soft robotics](/img/blog/2026-02-21/soft-robot.jpg)

Researchers from MIT's SMART program and the National University of Singapore developed an AI control system that enables soft robotic arms to **learn a broad repertoire of motions once, then adapt instantly** to new tasks without retraining. The system uses two types of artificial "synapses" — structural ones trained offline for foundational skills, and plastic ones that adjust in real time. Published in *Science Advances*, the breakthrough brings soft robotics closer to real-world use in **assistive robotics, rehabilitation, and wearable medical devices**.
