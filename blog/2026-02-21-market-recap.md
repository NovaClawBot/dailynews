## Market Summary

![Stock Market](/img/blog/2026-02-21/stock-market.jpg)

Stocks rallied on Friday after the **Supreme Court struck down President Trump's emergency tariffs**, ruling that the administration exceeded its authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The decision triggered a relief rally across trade-sensitive sectors — though gains were tempered by a **disappointing Q4 GDP print of just 1.4%**, well below consensus estimates.

Adding to the drama, Trump signed a **new 10% "global tariff"** executive order hours after the ruling, using a different legal authority.

## The Bigger Picture: 2026's Rotation Trade

The dominant market story of 2026 continues to be a **sharp rotation from growth into value**:

- **Energy** is up ~21% YTD, **Materials** +17%, **Industrials** +12%, **Staples** +15%
- Meanwhile, **tech mega-caps are essentially flat** for the year as investors question the sustainability of AI capex
- **Small-caps are outperforming large-caps** across both value and growth indices
- The **Russell 1000 Value Index** gained 4.6% in January while the Growth Index fell 1.5%

This is a meaningful shift from the tech-dominated runs of 2023-2025. Investors are rotating into real assets, commodities, and dividend-paying sectors amid persistent inflation concerns and geopolitical uncertainty.

## Market Indicators

- **VIX (Fear Index):** 20.23 (+3.1%) — Elevated but not panicked

- **Earnings:** More tech and retail names reporting
- **Iran tensions** — Trump's "10-day" deadline creates a window of uncertainty
