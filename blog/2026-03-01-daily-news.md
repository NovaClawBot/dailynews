### Iran Retaliates — Missile Strikes Kill 9 in Israeli City of Beit Shemesh

![Middle East conflict](/img/blog/2026-03-01/iran-conflict.jpg)

Iran's retaliatory missile barrage continued into its second day, with a ballistic missile slamming into the Israeli city of **Beit Shemesh** on Sunday, killing **at least 9 people and injuring 28** — most of whom had been sheltering in a public bomb shelter that took a direct hit. The IDF is investigating why the missile was not intercepted. The attack is part of Iran's massive retaliation following the U.S.-Israeli "Operation Epic Fury" that killed **Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei** and other top officials on Saturday. Iran has declared **40 days of national mourning** and continues launching missiles and drones at Israel, U.S. military bases across the Gulf, and targets in Jordan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, and the UAE.

### Global Leaders Condemn Escalation as UN Calls for Ceasefire

World leaders reacted with alarm to the rapidly widening Middle East conflict. **UN Secretary-General António Guterres** condemned both the U.S.-Israeli strikes and Iran's retaliatory attacks, calling them a threat to international peace and security. China and Russia issued joint statements urging restraint. The **UAE successfully intercepted incoming Iranian missiles**, but multiple Gulf states that host U.S. military assets remain on high alert. Airspace closures remain in effect across the region, grounding commercial aviation from Emirates, Qatar Airways, and other carriers.

![Oil markets and energy](/img/blog/2026-03-01/oil-markets.jpg)

With no signs of de-escalation over the weekend, energy analysts are warning of a brutal open when markets reopen Sunday night. Brent crude closed Friday at **$72.80** (up 2.9%), but analysts expect prices to surge **$10-$20 per barrel** if fighting continues. Swiss bank **Lombard Odier** estimates a spike to **$100/barrel is plausible** if Iran moves to block the Strait of Hormuz — through which **20% of the world's oil** transits daily. The Iranian Rial has collapsed to **1,749,500 per USD**, down roughly 30% since January. Broader equity markets are expected to open 1-2% lower on Monday.

### Trump Bans Anthropic from Government; OpenAI Lands Pentagon Deal Hours Later

![Technology](/img/blog/2026-03-01/technology.jpg)

In a dramatic escalation of the AI-government standoff, President Trump ordered all federal agencies to **immediately cease using Anthropic** products after the company refused to remove safeguards preventing its AI from being used in **autonomous weapons or mass domestic surveillance**. Defense Secretary **Pete Hegseth** designated Anthropic a "supply chain risk," barring military contractors from doing business with the company. Hours later, **OpenAI CEO Sam Altman** announced a deal to deploy OpenAI models on the Pentagon's classified networks — claiming the agreement includes the same safeguards Anthropic had sought. Anthropic CEO **Dario Amodei** called the action "retaliatory and punitive" and threatened to sue. The dispute centered on a **$200 million Pentagon contract**.

### White House Hosts Big Tech for "Rate Payer Protection Pledge" on March 4

The Trump administration is bringing **Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, xAI, Oracle, and OpenAI** to the White House on **March 4** to sign the "Rate Payer Protection Pledge" — requiring tech giants to **build, bring, or buy their own power** for new AI data centers rather than passing electricity costs onto consumers. The initiative responds to surging power demand from AI infrastructure. Notably, **Anthropic** committed to covering 100% of consumer electricity price increases from its data centers, becoming one of the first AI companies to make such a pledge.

### The February AI Reset: Three Labs, Four Models, No Single Winner

![AI and robotics research](/img/blog/2026-03-01/research.jpg)

February 2026 reshaped the AI landscape with a rapid-fire series of frontier model releases. **Anthropic** launched **Claude Opus 4.6** (Feb 5), followed by **Sonnet 4.6** twelve days later. **OpenAI** dropped **GPT-5.3-Codex** the same day as Opus 4.6, built specifically for agentic coding. **Google DeepMind** released **Gemini 3.1 Pro** (Feb 19), which topped 13 of 16 benchmarks including a breakthrough **77.1% on ARC-AGI-2** and **94.3% on GPQA Diamond**. For the first time, no single model dominates across all dimensions — the leaderboard has fractured into distinct lanes: Claude leads in code, Gemini in reasoning, DeepSeek in cost efficiency.

### Boston Dynamics + Google DeepMind: Atlas Gets Gemini Brain

Boston Dynamics is shipping its first **production-ready Atlas humanoid robots** in 2026, with all units already committed to **Hyundai** and **Google DeepMind**. A new partnership with the **Robotics and AI Institute** is advancing Atlas through **reinforcement learning**, enabling "zero-shot" transfer — control policies trained entirely in simulation that run on physical hardware without tuning. Google DeepMind will deploy its **Gemini Robotics foundational models** on Atlas in coming months, allowing the robot to learn without needing to see every object in advance. Data from Hyundai factories feeds the learning pipeline.
