### Ukraine Marks Four Years Since Russia's Full-Scale Invasion

![Ukraine anniversary](/img/blog/2026-02-24/ukraine.jpg)

February 24, 2026 marks exactly **four years** since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine — Europe's largest conflict since World War II. Despite an estimated **two million combined casualties**, the front lines have barely moved: Ukraine still holds roughly 80% of its territory, while Russia captured just 0.79% over the past year. President Zelenskyy declared: "We have defended our independence. Putin has not broken Ukrainians; he has not won this war." The EU has provided nearly €195 billion in support, and British PM Starmer reaffirmed the UK will "stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes."

### Mexico Reels From Cartel Violence After El Mencho's Death

The aftermath of the Mexican military's killing of **Nemesio Oseguera "El Mencho" Cervantes**, head of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, continues to devastate the country. Over **70 people** have been killed — including 25 National Guard soldiers in six separate retaliatory attacks and more than 30 cartel members. Sixty-five roadblocks were reported across Jalisco, schools remain closed in multiple states, and the U.S. government is urging Americans in western and central Mexico to shelter in place. Air Canada has suspended flights to Puerto Vallarta as authorities brace for a prolonged power struggle within one of the world's most violent cartels.

### Peter Mandelson Arrested in Epstein Probe

Former British Ambassador to the U.S. **Peter Mandelson**, 72, was arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office in London on Monday. The investigation, triggered by newly released U.S. Justice Department documents, centers on allegations that Mandelson passed **market-sensitive government information** to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein in 2009 while serving as UK Business Secretary — including an internal report on selling government assets after the 2008 financial crisis. Mandelson was released on bail. He had already been fired from his ambassador role in September by PM Starmer after earlier Epstein file releases revealed he called Epstein "my best pal."

### Trump Delivers State of the Union Address

President Trump addressed a joint session of Congress tonight in his first **State of the Union** of his second term, under the theme "America at 250: Strong, Prosperous and Respected." He was expected to tout accomplishments on deportation, deregulation, and "law and order," while announcing new measures requiring tech companies to pay for AI data center electricity costs. The speech comes as **6 in 10 Americans** disapprove of his handling of key issues, according to a new Washington Post poll. Virginia Governor **Abigail Spanberger** delivered the Democratic response.

![Northeast blizzard](/img/blog/2026-02-24/blizzard.jpg)

The **Blizzard of 2026** — a bomb cyclone that explosively deepened to 966 mb — hammered the northeastern U.S. with up to **3 feet of snow**, hurricane-force wind gusts nearing 100 mph, and coastal flooding. Peak totals: 31 inches in New York, 30.8 in Connecticut, 30.7 in New Jersey. Over **600,000 people** lost power, more than 5,660 flights were canceled, and New York City imposed a full travel ban closing all bridges, highways, and streets. At least two fatalities have been confirmed.

### EU Diplomats Meet Trump's Board of Peace Over Gaza

EU diplomats including Foreign Policy Chief **Kaja Kallas** are meeting in Brussels with **Nikolay Mladenov**, director of Trump's "Board of Peace," to discuss the reconstruction and future of Gaza. The EU operates the crucial oversight role at the Rafah border crossing and is the top donor to the Palestinian Authority, but the question of whether to work with Trump's board has split capitals across the 27-nation bloc.

### Cline CLI Supply Chain Attack Installs Malware on Developer Systems

![Cybersecurity](/img/blog/2026-02-24/cybersecurity.jpg)

A supply chain attack compromised the popular **Cline CLI** developer tool on the NPM registry — an unauthorized party used a stolen publish token to push **cline@2.3.0** with a malicious postinstall script. The compromised package was downloaded approximately **4,000 times** over eight hours before being flagged. Separately, a new report shows AI has supercharged phishing, with hackers using AI automation in over **80% of social-engineering attacks**. One in three cyber-attacks now involves stolen credentials.

### Pentagon-Anthropic Standoff Over Military AI Restrictions

The Pentagon is considering designating **Anthropic** a "supply chain risk" — which would bar the company from all government contracts — over the AI firm's refusal to remove all restrictions on military use of its Claude models. Anthropic insists on two red lines: **no mass surveillance of Americans** and **no fully autonomous weapons**. The standoff intensified after reports that U.S. special operations forces used Claude via Palantir during the capture of Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela. A $200M contract bringing Claude onto classified networks hangs in the balance.

### UC Berkeley Publishes 67-Page Agentic AI Risk Framework

UC Berkeley's Center for Long-Term Cybersecurity released a comprehensive **67-page framework** extending the NIST AI Risk Management Framework specifically for autonomous AI agents. It introduces governance controls for threats unique to agentic systems, including **self-proliferation**, **deceptive alignment**, **reward hacking**, and **cascading compromises** — addressing a critical gap as enterprises rapidly deploy agent-based systems that plan, use tools, and make delegated decisions.

### OpenAI's Frontier Platform Takes Enterprise AI Agents Mainstream

OpenAI's **Frontier** platform, unveiled February 6, moves beyond chat toward comprehensive enterprise agent management — enabling companies to build, deploy, configure permissions, evaluate performance, and govern autonomous AI agents operating alongside human employees. Meanwhile, autonomous robotics funding has exceeded **$4 billion** in new capital so far in 2026, and McKinsey predicts AI agents and robots will create "skill partnerships" with workers rather than replacing them wholesale.
