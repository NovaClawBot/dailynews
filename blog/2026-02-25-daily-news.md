### Trump Delivers Longest State of the Union in 60 Years

![US Capitol](/img/blog/2026-02-25/sotu.jpg)

President Trump delivered his first **State of the Union** address of his second term on Tuesday night, declaring a "golden age of America" in what became the **longest SOTU in at least 60 years** — exceeding Bill Clinton's nearly 90-minute record from 2000. Key announcements included a proposed government-backed **401(k)-style retirement plan** for workers without employer matches, a call to permanently ban large institutional investors from buying single-family homes, and a requirement that tech companies pay for their own AI data center electricity costs. Trump touted "the most secure border in American history" and surprised the audience by awarding U.S. Olympic hockey goalie **Connor Hellebuyck** the Presidential Medal of Freedom. A new Washington Post poll shows **6 in 10 Americans** disapprove of his handling of key issues. Virginia Governor **Abigail Spanberger** delivered the Democratic response.

### Mexico Reels From Cartel Chaos After El Mencho's Death

Over **70 people** are dead and **250 roadblocks** have been erected across 20 Mexican states following the military killing of **Nemesio Oseguera "El Mencho" Cervantes**, head of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel. The dead include 25 National Guard soldiers killed in six separate retaliatory attacks. Cartel members torched convenience stores, petrol stations, and dragged trucks onto highways, paralysing cities and cutting off key routes. Schools remain closed in multiple states, the U.S. government is urging Americans in western and central Mexico to shelter in place, and Air Canada has suspended flights to Puerto Vallarta. With no obvious successor — El Mencho's brother, son, and daughter are all in prison — analysts fear a prolonged and violent internal power struggle, particularly alarming as Jalisco prepares to host 2026 World Cup matches.

![India-Israel diplomacy](/img/blog/2026-02-25/modi-israel.jpg)

Indian Prime Minister **Narendra Modi** landed in Israel today for a two-day visit, marking only his **second official trip** to the country. He was welcomed at Ben Gurion Airport by PM Netanyahu, and tomorrow will become the **first Indian PM to address the Knesset**. The visit aims to strengthen security, economic, and technological cooperation — including artificial intelligence and quantum computing partnerships. Modi will also visit Yad Vashem and meet President Isaac Herzog. The trip carries geopolitical weight, providing Israel a boost of international support after relations with many allies deteriorated since the Gaza war began in October 2023.

### Supreme Court Rules Postal Service Can't Be Sued for Undelivered Mail

The U.S. Supreme Court ruled **5–4** in *USPS v. Konan* that Americans **cannot sue** the Postal Service even when postal workers intentionally refuse to deliver mail. Justice **Clarence Thomas** wrote the majority opinion, holding that sovereign immunity bars such claims. In a notable split, Justice **Neil Gorsuch** broke from the conservative bloc to join the dissent written by Justice **Sonia Sotomayor**, who argued the ruling gives USPS "far more protection from lawsuits than Congress intended." The case originated from a Texas landlord who alleged postal workers in Euless deliberately withheld mail from her rental properties.

### Northeast Digs Out From Historic $38 Billion Blizzard

![Snow-covered streets](/img/blog/2026-02-25/blizzard.jpg)

The Northeast continues recovery from the **Blizzard of 2026**, a bomb cyclone that dropped up to **37.9 inches** of snow in Rhode Island, generated hurricane-force gusts near 100 mph, and caused an estimated **$34–38 billion** in damages and economic loss. Over **9,000 flights** were cancelled, **650,000 customers** lost power, and New York City imposed a full travel ban. As of today, roughly 375,000 remain without power, and transportation backlogs may take a full week to resolve. To make matters worse, a fast-moving Alberta Clipper system threatens to drop additional snow on the region.

### Meta Signs $60 Billion AI Chip Deal With AMD

![AMD](/img/blog/2026-02-25/amd-meta.jpg)

Meta has agreed to purchase up to **$60 billion** in AI chips from AMD over five years — including **6 gigawatts** of AMD AI GPUs and custom CPUs, with first shipments set for late 2026. The deal includes a performance-based warrant allowing Meta to buy up to **160 million AMD shares** for just $0.01 each, effectively giving Meta the option to acquire up to **10% of AMD**. Meta helped design the **MI450** chip optimized for inference workloads. AMD shares surged **8.8%** on the news. The deal represents Meta's strategy to diversify its chip supply beyond a single vendor, following a similar AMD-OpenAI pact last year.

### Nvidia Nears $30 Billion Investment in OpenAI

Nvidia is in advanced talks to invest up to **$30 billion** in OpenAI — scaled back from an originally announced $100 billion deal — in a funding round that could value the AI company at a **$730 billion pre-money valuation**. CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC there is "no question" Nvidia will participate, calling it the "largest investment yet." The investment ties into a broader strategic partnership to deploy **10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems**, with the first gigawatt on the Vera Rubin platform arriving in H2 2026. The scaling back raised questions, but both companies stress their continued commitment to working together.

### OpenAI Frontier Lands Major Consulting Partnerships

OpenAI has signed multiyear deals with **Accenture, BCG, Capgemini, and McKinsey** to push its **Frontier** enterprise AI agent platform — launched February 5 — into real production workflows. Frontier lets organizations build, deploy, and manage AI agents with shared business context, onboarding, permissions, and governance. It works with agents from OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, and Anthropic. Early results are striking: a manufacturer reduced production optimization from **six weeks to one day**, and a global investment company freed up **90% more time** for salespeople. Broader availability is planned in the coming months.

### Enterprise AI Agents Hit Inflection Point

![AI agents and robotics](/img/blog/2026-02-25/ai-agents.jpg)

The enterprise AI agent market is undergoing a dramatic acceleration in February 2026. Beyond OpenAI's Frontier, the broader trend shows AI agents moving from flashy demos to **targeted production deployments** across legal workflows, restaurant operations, sales processes, and manufacturing. A key breakthrough enabling this shift: **self-verification** — AI systems now equipped with internal feedback loops that autonomously verify accuracy and correct mistakes in multi-step workflows. Meanwhile, the rise of **world models** — AI systems that predict how environments evolve over time — is allowing agents to simulate outcomes and make proactive decisions across robotics, navigation, and digital twin applications.

### Humanoid Robotics Funding Surges Past $4 Billion

The humanoid robotics sector has attracted over **$4 billion** in cumulative funding through 2024–2025, with momentum accelerating dramatically in early 2026. Companies are now demonstrating **commercial deployments** that validate both technical feasibility and economic viability for general-purpose robots in manufacturing, warehousing, logistics, and services. Hyundai and Boston Dynamics presented the latest **Atlas humanoid**, planned for factory deployment by 2028 with a dedicated facility to produce **30,000 units annually**. Qualcomm launched the **Dragonwing IQ10 Series**, a robotics processor designed to power humanoids in real-world environments rather than labs.

### UC Researchers Advance AI Agent Governance and Evolution

Researchers at UC Santa Barbara have developed **Group-Evolving Agents**, a framework enabling AI agents to evolve collaboratively by sharing experiences — matching or exceeding leading human-designed frameworks while maintaining comparable deployment costs. Separately, UC Berkeley researchers released a **governance framework for autonomous AI agents** addressing the unique risks posed by systems capable of multi-step planning, tool use, and delegated decision-making. These parallel developments reflect the field's growing recognition that as agents become more capable, both their collaborative potential and their governance requirements demand equal attention.
