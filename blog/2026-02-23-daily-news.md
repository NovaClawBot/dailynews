### Mexico Erupts in Violence After Army Kills Cartel Leader "El Mencho"

![Mexican security operations](/img/blog/2026-02-23/mexico.jpg)

Mexico's military killed **Nemesio Rubén Oseguera Cervantes**, known as "El Mencho," the leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG), during an operation in Jalisco state on Saturday. The killing triggered immediate and widespread retaliatory violence across at least **15 states**, with armed groups setting up roadblocks, torching vehicles and buses, and clashing with security forces. Guadalajara was reduced to a ghost town, schools were shut across multiple states, Air Canada suspended flights to Puerto Vallarta, and authorities on both sides of the border are bracing for a prolonged power struggle inside one of the world's most violent criminal organizations.

### Armed Man Shot Dead at Mar-a-Lago Security Perimeter

U.S. Secret Service agents and a Palm Beach County Sheriff's deputy shot and killed **Austin Tucker Martin**, 21, of North Carolina, after he breached the secure perimeter of Mar-a-Lago around 1:30 AM on Saturday carrying a shotgun and a fuel can. Martin, who had been reported missing by his family the day before, raised the weapon to a shooting position before agents neutralized the threat. President Trump and the First Lady were at the White House at the time. FBI Director Kash Patel announced a full investigation.

### U.S.-Iran Tensions Drive Oil Prices Higher; Strait of Hormuz in Focus

![Oil markets](/img/blog/2026-02-23/oil-prices.jpg)

Crude oil prices continued climbing amid escalating U.S.-Iran tensions, with **WTI near $67/barrel** and **Brent approaching $72** — reflecting a $7–$10 geopolitical risk premium. Iran's recent live-fire drills in the Strait of Hormuz, which handles roughly **20 million barrels per day**, sent a clear signal during ongoing nuclear talks. Analysts warn an extended closure or escalation could lift crude by 15–20%, potentially pushing gas prices from $2.50 to $5 per gallon.

### EU Diplomats Meet Board of Peace Director Over Gaza's Future

EU top diplomats, including Foreign Policy Chief **Kaja Kallas**, are meeting Monday in Brussels with **Nikolay Mladenov**, the director of Trump's "Board of Peace," to discuss the reconstruction and future of war-ravaged Gaza. The EU has deep ties to both Israel and the Palestinians, operates a crucial oversight role at the Rafah border crossing, and is the top donor to the Palestinian Authority — but the question of whether to work with Trump's board has split capitals across the 27-nation bloc.

### Pentagon-Anthropic Showdown: "Supply Chain Risk" Designation Threatened

![The Pentagon](/img/blog/2026-02-23/pentagon.jpg)

The Pentagon is considering designating **Anthropic** a "supply chain risk" — which would bar the company from all government contracts and force Pentagon contractors to sever ties — over the AI firm's refusal to remove all restrictions on military use of its models. The feud intensified after reports that U.S. special operations forces used Claude via Palantir during the January capture of Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela. Anthropic insists two red lines remain: **no mass surveillance of Americans** and **no fully autonomous weapons**. The $200M contract, which brought Claude onto classified networks, hangs in the balance.

### McKinsey: AI Agents and Robots Will Create "Skill Partnerships" With Workers

A new McKinsey Global Institute report argues that the era of **AI agents and robots** will reshape work not through wholesale replacement, but through "skill partnerships" — where humans, AI agents, and physical robots collaborate on complementary tasks. The report identifies manufacturing, logistics, and healthcare as sectors where these partnerships will emerge first, requiring significant reskilling investments.
