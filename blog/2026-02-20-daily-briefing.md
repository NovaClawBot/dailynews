### Mechanistic Interpretability Named MIT Breakthrough of 2026

MIT Technology Review named [mechanistic interpretability](https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/12/1130003/mechanistic-interpretability-ai-research-models-2026-breakthrough-technologies/) one of its **10 Breakthrough Technologies of 2026**, driven largely by Anthropic's circuit tracing research. The technique lets researchers watch how LLMs think by tracing feature sequences from prompt to response, revealing a shared conceptual space where reasoning happens before being translated into language. Anthropic used it for pre-deployment safety assessment of Claude Sonnet 4.5.
